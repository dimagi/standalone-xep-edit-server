This is a standalone server that implements the XForms Editing Protocol (XEP) for the editor's side,
with simple hooks so that you can use it to integrate your own XForms Editor into CommCare HQ.

The easiest way to test it is with standalone-xep-hq-server, which is a reference implementation of the XEP
on the HQ side.

Before proceeding, please install the two dependencies:
- CouchDB 1.0.1 or later (available at http://couch.io/get)
- Django ("pip install django" or "easy_install django")

To get set up fast, you can run xep-setup.sh (it assumes you are reading this on github will download both
standalone-xep-hq-server and standalone-xep-edit-server into a directory called ./xep/). This will also start
both servers. The hq server will run on port 8010, and the edit server will run on port 8011.

Both standalone servers come with an example HQ/Editor, so it will run out of the box; you just have to replace
example_editor with your actual editor by changing the variable XEP_EDITOR in settings.py . To test the
out-of-the-box setup, go over to http://localhost:8010/HQ/ .
