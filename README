This is a standalone server that implements the XForms Editing Protocol (XEP) for the editor's side,
with simple hooks so that you can use it to integrate your own XForms Editor into CommCare HQ.

The easiest way to test it is with standalone-xep-hq-server, which is a reference implementation of the XEP
on the HQ side.

Before proceeding, please install the two dependencies:
- CouchDB 1.0.1 or later (available at http://couch.io/get)
- Django ("pip install django" or "easy_install django")

To get set up fast, you can run xep-setup.sh. It's a bootstrapper, so download it first, and it will download this project as well as the standalone-xep-hq-server. Once you're done, you should run the hq server on port 8010, and the edit server on port 8011.

Both standalone servers come with an example HQ/Editor, so it will run out of the box. To test the
out-of-the-box setup, go over to http://localhost:8010/HQ/ .

Next link it up to your editor (which I'm sure is much better than the example :) ). To get started open
    settings.py
and find the variable XEP_EDITOR at the bottom. There should be instructions on how to proceed from there.
