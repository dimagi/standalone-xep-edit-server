This is a standalone server that implements the XForms Editing Protocol (XEP) for the editor's side,
with simple hooks so that you can use it to integrate your own XForms Editor into CommCare HQ.

The easiest way to test it is with standalone_xep_hq_server, which is a reference implementation of the XEP
on the HQ side.
